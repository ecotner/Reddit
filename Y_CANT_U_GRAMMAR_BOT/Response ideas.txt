Alot:

1)     a lot\nFTFY
2) Hey, so I don't want to sound like a douche here, but 'alot' is actually two words: 'a lot'. Just FYI.\n\nIdiot.
3) Yo, I think you're confusing the alot, [a large fictitious creature](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TRIo4br3I/AAAAAAAACv4/Zh7_GcMlRKo/s400/ALOT.png) popularized by the blog [Hyperbole and a Half](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html), with the the phrase 'a lot', which means 'many' or 'often' depending on context. Just wanted you to know so you don't look like an idiot in the future. Not that you look like an idiot now! You look great! Very sexy.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that your looks are probably your best quality... but you should probably read more books.
